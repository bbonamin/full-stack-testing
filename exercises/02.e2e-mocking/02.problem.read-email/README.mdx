# Read Email

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/web-application-testing/end-to-end-mocking/reading-email-from-disk-in-test-environment" />

👨‍💼 Now we can read the email in our test and let the rest of it proceed
properly. First, you should go to <InlineFile file="tests/mocks/resend.ts" /> to
add a `requireEmail` utility function. Then you'll go
to <InlineFile file="tests/e2e/onboarding.test.ts" /> and use that.

Once you've done that, we should be good to go!

```sh nonumber
npx playwright test --ui
```
